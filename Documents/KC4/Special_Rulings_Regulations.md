<h1 align="center">Special Rulings Regulations</h1>

## 1. Procedure of issuing Special Rulings

1.1 In the case of a majority vote, the Committee Chef issues a Special Ruling by publishing it on Github or Discord.

1.2 Decisions that may be made by Special Ruling:

- 1). Approving new versions of the Tournament Rules,
- 2). Change of establishment, change of composition and dissolution of the Judges Committee,
- 3). Providing thanks and congratulations to Players and persons performing Official Functions,
- 4). Awarding 1st, 2nd and 3rd place in accordance with the relevant point of the Regulations,
- 5). Revocation of the Ruling, Special Ruling or other Document mentioned in the relevant point of the Regulations,
- 6). Interpretation of an unclear point of the Tournament Rules,
- 7). Repealing the decision of the Committee or a Committee Member, excluding appeals against decisions in accordance with the relevant point of the Regulations,
- 8). Assignment of Committee Members to specific areas of the Tournament,
- 9). Establishing a rule applicable to the Tournament, without updating other Tournament Rules,

## 2. Shape of Special Rulings

2.1 The Special Ruling consists of the Special Ruling Number, the Content of the Special Ruling and information about the issuing person.

2.2 The Special Ruling Number consists of the # character, 2 digits, a dash, 2 digits and the letters KC (e.g. #04-01KC). The first two digits indicate in which edition of the Tournament a given Special Ruling is valid, while the next two digits indicate the ordinal number of the Special Ruling. The higher the ordinal number of the Special Ruling, the more force it has, therefore, if Special Ruling #04-01KC is inconsistent with Special Ruling #04-06KC, Special Ruling #04-06KC is binding.

2.3 The content of the Special Ruling is divided into points (not all listed points need to be included in every Special Ruling):

- 1). Tournament Rules - decisions from paragraph 1). and 5). point 1.2,
- 2). Judges Committee - decisions from paragraph 2). and 7).-8). point 1.2,
- 3). Thanks and congratulations - decisions from paragraph 3). point 1.2
- 4). Winners - decisions from section 4). point 1.2
- 5). Interpretation - decisions from paragraph 6). point 1.2
- 6). Provisions - decisions from paragraph 9). point 1.2
