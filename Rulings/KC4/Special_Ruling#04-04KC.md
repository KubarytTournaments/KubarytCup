<h1 align="center">Special Ruling #04-04KC</h1>

## 1. Provisions

1.1 Paragraph 3). point 1.5 of the Regulations does not prevent a situation in which, in the elimination phase, two Players who were in the same group in the group phase meet each other in one Match. Therefore, I decide that in addition to the place in the group in the group phase and the Kammer Ranking System, the seeding in the elimination phase will also be influenced by whether Players who should have been seeded together played in the same group in the group phase.

1.2 As a result of the provisions of point 1.1, there are changes in the 2 Matches of the elimination phase:
   - in the Match `dimidino` vs `Kirajer87`, the second one is replaced by Player `mkinas888`,
   - in the `Jabolpunk` vs `mkinas888` Match, the latter is replaced by the Player `Kirasjer87`.
