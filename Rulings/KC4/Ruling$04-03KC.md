## 1. Overtimes

1.1 Based on informations given by the Players, I determine, that overtimes in group 8 ended with following result:

- 1st place Spartakus - 2 points,
- 2nd place burymistrz - 1 point,
- 3rd place Jaa209 - 0 points.

1.1b This means, that in elimination phase Spartakus with play a Match with Player `HatredDevours`, and burymistrz with Player `Klaudo98`

## 2. Change of the Match playing system

2.1 Due to delays caused by overtimes, I change playing system from Bo3 to Bo1 in the following Matches:

- Spartakus vs HatredDevours,
- Klaudo98 vs burymistrz.
