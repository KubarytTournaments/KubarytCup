## 6. Restarts

6.1 Red is the first that has to decide if they take a restart, blue is second. (If blue passes turn intending to take a restart, in order to not give it away, and then red does not take restart and ends turn, blue has to write 111 in the first 5 seconds after accepting his turn. After that time, blue has to play the map).

6.2 The players can take technical restarts. Technical restarts are available if the map is bugged, there is no passage to the next zone, there is no town in the starting zone, or when the map is blocked by a powerful guard making it impossible to explore the map or develop. This needs to be the case on 111 or 112. Only a judge can decide about a technical restart.

6.3 Technical restarsts can be used from 111 to 114 inclusive. If players can't reach an agreement about technical restart, decision must be consultated with the **Judge**

6.4 Early meeting restarts. If players interact with each other in early turns, each of them has the right to ask for a technical restart. The last day on which that is allowed is 115 for fast roads, 116 for average, 117 for slow.  Interaction between players is defined as any battle between players, or taking over any object belonging to another player (empty mines, towns, etc.). Bear in mind, if simultaneous turns get interrupted, that does not mean an interaction happened. If by the time Blue finishes their turn, there was no interaction, there are no grounds for technical reset.

The rule does not apply on mirror templates.

## 7. Fair play rules

7.1 Do not use crashes for your advantage. If the game is re-loaded due to a crash, the players should do their best to recreate their moves on the adventure map and in combat in the turn in which error occurred. If a judge decides that moves were not repeated faithfully enough, they can ask players to reload again. If a player purposely changed his moves to gain an advantage, the organiser can punish them with a technical loss. If after loading the game a player has more time than before, they should spend that excess with their town or hero screen open - not analyzing the game or playing. In case of low timer these actions could result in an undeserved advantage.

7.2 External help. There are many ways of getting additional information useful in an ongoing game. Below is a list of them, with a decision whether or not it’s acceptable:

- Advice (a third party provides a player with information that could be logically deduced by watching only that player’s side of the game) through text: Allowed
- Advice via phone, teamspeak, skype, etc. providing voice and / or video conversations: Forbidden
- Spoilers (a third party provides a player with information that could not be logically deduced by watching only that player’s side of the game): > > > - Forbidden - if a player reads a spoiler they should play as if they haven’t seen it.
- Ghosting (watching your opponent’s stream): Forbidden
- Programs reading game’s memory - for example to see the map or foresee the skilltree of a hero: Forbidden
- Value calculators: Allowed
- Damage calculators: Allowed
- Wiki pages: Allowed
- Recording of your own stream: Allowed
- Screenshots: Allowed
- Video guides: Allowed
- Personal notes about the game: Allowed

7.3 Standard hota online gameplay rules. Link to them is here. If a rule in the tournament rules conflicts with the one in standard hota rules, the tournament rule takes priority.

## 8. Penalties

8.1 **Tournament organizer** and **Judge** have some means of punishing players for not adhering to the rules and in unusual situations. Penalty levels:

- Warning - received for trivial infractions. First warning has no consequences, but every next warning causes additional penalties:
  - Second warning - walkover for game
  - Third warning - disqualification
- Walkover for game - received for small infractions, included failure to meet deadlines
- Disqualification - received for big infractions
- Ban - received for serious infractions, works like disquailfication, but doesn't allow you to play in the tournament for a definite or indefinite period

8.2 Informations about receiving a penatly with the reason of it will be published on #Rulings-orzeczenia channel on **Discord**

8.3 Player can appeal the Judges' decision until the end of the current phase. 

## 9. Game conclusion

- After the game is played, the defeated player types “gg” both in case of the game being ranked, and in case it was not. “gg” in that case means admitting defeat, and can be a proof when writing a report.
Report after the finished game should be written on www.h3.gg. You can find an option to add a report on the match detail page for your match. The report needs to be confirmed by your opponent, or a judge.
After the game the players are obligated to exchange save passwords.
