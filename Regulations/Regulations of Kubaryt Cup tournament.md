3.3. Player who join the room choose 0 or 1 digit, host performs the coin flip (option avaible in PVP-options bookmark). Player who wins coin flip starts process of template eliminating. In BO1 games players are banning alternately until one template remains. In BOX games players are banning alternately until X templates remains. Players choose templates to matches alternately starting from player who banned penultimate template. All games have to take place on diffrent templates.

3.4. Mirror templates (h3dm1, mt_firewalk, etc.)
- The host selects town via clicking “Random Town”(feature for it is available in PvP Options).

- After re-rolls the players bid for color. Winner of coin flip starts. Winner of the bid picks color. Red bans up to 3 heroes (if any of banned heroes hows up in a tavern on 111 with the army, you should inform your opponent about it and a technical restart is called) and picks a starting bonus. Blue can pick a hero first, out of the ones that are not banned.

3.5. Non-mirror templates (Jebus, 6lm10a, etc.)
- Town is selected via a Random Town vs Random Town feature of PvP options. The players declare whether they want a re-roll for 500 gold (with 0-2 towns from the original pair banned), starting with the coin toss winner. Each player can only pay for one re-roll.
- After re-rolls the winner of coin flip starts bidding for town first, and then for color.

### 4.8.

> Template: LKubaryt
> Rules in LKubaryt.md on github: https://github.com/Kubaryt/Kubaryt/tree/HotA-templates/templates/LKubaryt

## 5. Restarts

5.1. Red is the first that has to decide if they take a restart, blue is second. (If blue passes turn intending to take a restart, in order to not give it away, and then red does not take restart and ends turn, blue has to write 111 in the first 5 seconds after accepting his turn. After that time, blue has to play the map).

5.2. The players can take technical restarts. Technical restarts are available if the map is bugged, there is no passage to the next zone, there is no town in the starting zone, or when the map is blocked by a powerful guard making it impossible to explore the map or develop. This needs to be the case on 111 or 112. Only a judge can decide about a technical restart.

5.3. Early meeting restarts. If players interact with each other in early turns, each of them has the right to ask for a technical restart. The last day on which that is allowed is 115 for fast roads, 116 for average, 117 for slow.  Interaction between players is defined as any battle between players, or taking over any object belonging to another player (empty mines, towns, etc.). Bear in mind, if simultaneous turns get interrupted, that does not mean an interaction happened. If by the time Blue finishes their turn, there was no interaction, there are no grounds for technical reset.

The rule does not apply on mirror templates. 

# 6. Fair play rules

6.1. Do not use crashes for your advantage. If the game is re-loaded due to a crash, the players should do their best to recreate their moves on the adventure map and in combat in the turn in which error occurred. If a judge decides that moves were not repeated faithfully enough, they can ask players to reload again. If a player purposely changed his moves to gain an advantage, the organiser can punish them with a technical loss. If after loading the game a player has more time than before, they should spend that excess with their town or hero screen open - not analyzing the game or playing. In case of low timer these actions could result in an undeserved advantage.

6.2. External help. There are many ways of getting additional information useful in an ongoing game. Below is a list of them, with a decision whether or not it’s acceptable:

- Advice (a third party provides a player with information that could be logically deduced by watching only that player’s side of the game) through text: Allowed
- Advice via phone, teamspeak, skype, etc. providing voice and / or video conversations: Forbidden
- Spoilers (a third party provides a player with information that could not be logically deduced by watching only that player’s side of the game): > > > - Forbidden - if a player reads a spoiler they should play as if they haven’t seen it.
- Ghosting (watching your opponent’s stream): Forbidden
- Programs reading game’s memory - for example to see the map or foresee the skilltree of a hero: Forbidden
- Value calculators: Allowed
- Damage calculators: Allowed
- Wiki pages: Allowed
- Recording of your own stream: Allowed
- Screenshots: Allowed
- Video guides: Allowed
- Personal notes about the game: Allowed

6.3. Standard hota online gameplay rules. Link to them is here. If a rule in the tournament rules conflicts with the one in standard hota rules, the tournament rule takes priority. 

## 7. Game conclusion

- After the game is played, the defeated player types “gg” both in case of the game being ranked, and in case it was not. “gg” in that case means admitting defeat, and can be a proof when writing a report.
Report after the finished game should be written on www.h3.gg. You can find an option to add a report on the match detail page for your match. The report needs to be confirmed by your opponent, or a judge. 
After the game the players are obligated to exchange save passwords.
